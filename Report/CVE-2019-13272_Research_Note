[testbed]
I tested some testbeds on My VMware VMs.
And as below two platform discussed to occur vulnerable Linux distributions.
It's easily 1 sec left.

// - Ubuntu 16.04.5 kernel 4.15.0-29-generic [ v ] [ x ] Compile but pkexec error to failed to be pwn!
// - Ubuntu Mate 18.04.2 kernel 4.18.0-15-generic [ v ] [ O ] Compile and rootshell pwn!
// - Xubuntu 16.04.4 kernel 4.13.0-36-generic [ v ] [ O ] Comple and rootshell pwn!
// - Fedora Workstation 30 kernel 5.0.9-301.fc30.x86_64 [ v ] [ x ] slower and stopped.

I tested four platforms of 20.

Fun!
