chain: lack of synchronization leads to memory corruption
체인: 동기화 결여로 메모리 커럽션 발생.

CVE-2021-29529
Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
CVE-2009-0558
attacker-controlled array index leads to code execution
CVE-2009-0269
chain: -1 value from a function call was intended to indicate an error, but is used as an array index instead.
